I’m excited to learn more about your experience and how it aligns with the Senior Software Engineer (Backend) role here at Tech Solutions\\u202fInc.  \\n\\nA quick snapshot of our company: we’re a fast‑paced, innovative software development firm with 500‑1000 employees. Our mission is to empower businesses with cutting‑edge technology solutions that drive efficiency and innovation. On the backend side, we build scalable services using Python, Java, and Go, and we heavily rely on AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Kafka to deliver reliable, high‑performance products.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Question 1:**  \\nCould you walk me through how you would design a RESTful API endpoint for a new feature that needs to retrieve user analytics data from PostgreSQL, cache the results in Redis, and publish an event to Kafka for downstream processing? Please include considerations for authentication, rate limiting, and error handling.'},\n",

First, I’d check Redis for cached analytics; if missing, query PostgreSQL, then cache the result. After retrieval, I’d publish an event to Kafka for downstream services. I’d handle errors with proper status codes (401, 429, 500) and return a JSON with the analytics and a cached flag.”'},\n",
